# unit_4_game

Crystal Collector...designed with JavaScript and jQuery.

The game will start automatically upon the page loading.

You will be given a random number at the start of the game.

There are four crystals on the page. By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points to your total score.

You win the game by matching your total score to the random number generated at the start of the game. If your score goes above the random number, you lose.

The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it.

Each time a new game starts, the values of each crystal will change.
